# BG-14: SMART WAREHOUSE SYSTEM

This file contains all the related program files used during the ideation of the smart warehouse system.
This includes a RFID Generator , which generates a unique RF-ID, corresponding to each of the invoices on the cargoes.

Smart bots, equipped with intelligent supervised Machine Learning Model, look for vacant grid slots within the Automated Storage and Retrieval System(ASRS) system. The bots are then used for cargo detail detection using the RFID, and are then placed within the ASRS system, at the desired location.

This also contains an OpenCV file, embedded within  RFID based cameras, which cross checks the bot for the correct placement of the cargoes according to the desired coordinates within the warehouse, and returns the location and an acknowledgement message to the central server.
